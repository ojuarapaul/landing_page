FreeCodeCamp Landing Page assignment
This is a simple technical documentation page, developed as an assigment of FreeCodeCamp Responsive Webdesign Certificate.
It has a pretty basic design, since it was one of the first pages I've developed. It's based on FCC template. Moreover I'm NOT a Webdesigner, I'm rather a web Developer... so, you gotta take this into account!
